Two-Way-Comm
============

In our project we intend to implement a two way half-duplex communication system on Altera  DE2-115 boards. Our system will have two FPGAâ€™s connected via an Ethernet cable. Each  FPGA board will have a speaker and microphone connected to it. Using this microphone a  person sitting next to one board will be able send an audio message to a person sitting next to the  other FPGA board. The other person will receive this message via the speaker. We will also  implement a MAC protocol for our Link layer. If time permits we will try implementing our  system on a LAN.
