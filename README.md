Two-Way-Comm
============

In our project we intend to implement a two way half-duplex communication system on Altera DE2-115 boards. Our system will have two FPGAâ€™s connected via the GPIO pins. Each FPGA board will have a speaker and microphone connected to it. Using this microphone a  person sitting next to one board will be able send an audio message to a person sitting next to another FPGA board. The other person will receive this message via the speaker.
